# CL-KNX
A KNXD client for Common Lisp using CFFI and the KNXD C library

### Prerequisites
A [knxd](https://github.com/knxd/knxd) server with the knxd c library
Compile KNXD with shared libries  `./configure --enable-shared` and ensure that libeibclient is available on under the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (found in the KNXD build directory under `knxd/src/client/c/.libs/libeibclient.so`)

##### knx-send
Sends a message on the KNX bus: `(knx-send url group message)`
* `url` is a url string to a knxd service e.g. `"ip:192.168.1.15:1234"`
* `group` is a list containing the destination group address e.g. `'(1 2 3)`
* `message` is a list generated by the `msg-encode` function

##### knx-read
Request a KNX group's value: `(knx-read url group [age])`
* `url` is a url string to a knxd service e.g. `"ip:192.168.1.15:1234"`
* `group` is a list containing the destination group address e.g. `'(1 2 3)`
* `age` is an optional paramter to set the maximum (seconds) a value can be cached before it needs to be re-read
* Returns a message list which can be decoded with the `msg-decode` function

##### knx-listen
Listen for any telegram from the KNX bus: `(knx-listen url)`
* `url` is a url string to a knxd service e.g. `"ip:192.168.1.15:1234"`
* Returns the first received telegram as a list in the of `(data type group source)`
    * `data` is the telegram payload which can be decoded with the `msg-decode` function
	* `type` is the telegram type: `request`, `response` or `write`
    * `group` is a list containing the destination group
    * `source` is a list containing the address of the source device

##### msg-encode
Converts a value into a knx telegram payload: `(msg-encode value type)`
* `value` is the value to encode
* `type` specifies the knx dpt type for the value
    * `dpt-1.*` is either `t` or `nil`
    * `dpt-5.001` is a percentage value between 0 and 100
    * `dpt-17.001` is a scene value between 1 and 50
    * `dpt-9.*` is a 16bit float
    * `dpt-14.*` is a 32bit float
	* `dpt-13.*` is a 32bit signed integer
*  Returns a payload list which can be sent using `knx-send`

##### msg-decode
Convert received telegram payload into a lisp value: `(msg-decode message type)`
* `message` is a received payload list
* `type` specifies the knx dpt type of the value
    * `dpt-1.*` is either `t` or `nil`
    * `dpt-5.001` is a percentage value between 0 and 100
    * `dpt-17.001` is a scene value between 1 and 50
    * `dpt-9.*` is a 16bit float
    * `dpt-14.*` is a 32bit float
	* `dpt-13.*` is a 32bit signed integer
*  Returns a lisp value

### Notes
* Currently only supports using 3 level group addresses and 3 level device addresses
